# NAI_Tutorials
Projects for a second-year subject in PJAIT - Artificial Intelligence Tools.

## üìÅ Structure
Each task is located under its own package inside the src/main/java/org/example/ (or org.example) directory:

- `KNN/` - package for K-Nearest Neighbors mini-programming project.
- `Perceptron/` - package for Perceptron mini-programming project.
- `SingleLayerNeuralNetwork` - package for Single-Layer Neural Network mini-programming project.
- `KMeans` - package for K-Means clustering mini-programming project.
- `Bayes` - package for Naive Bayes classifier mini-programming project.
- `BruteForce` - package for Brute Force mimi-programming project.

## üîç Mini-programming projects covered
**Mini-programming project 1: KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**

- Implements a basic KNN classifier with a custom sorting routine and tie-breaking logic.
- Demonstrates multi-class classification on the Iris dataset.
- Explores how changing k affects prediction accuracy.

**Mini-programming project 2: Perceptron**

- Implements the Delta Rule (gradient-based) for a single-layer perceptron.
- Demonstrates binary classification on a 2D subset of the Iris dataset.
- Shows how to plot the decision boundary in ASCII or export boundary points to a CSV file.

**Mini-programming project 3: Single-Layer Neural Network**

- Implements a basic one-vs-rest neural architecture using multiple perceptrons.
- Designed for multi-class classification of text-based language detection tasks.
- Each perceptron is trained to recognize one language by distinguishing it from others.
- Supports text vectorization through normalized letter-frequency mapping (a‚Äìz).
- Demonstrates prediction on both vectorized inputs and raw user-provided text.

**Mini-programming project 4: Naive Bayes Classifier**

- Implements a categorical Naive Bayes classifier with optional Laplace smoothing.
- Precomputes prior and conditional probabilities during training.
- Classifies new data and evaluates results using accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure.

**Mini-programming project 5: K-Means Clustering**

- Implements the K-Means algorithm for unsupervised clustering on the Iris dataset.
- Randomly initializes cluster assignments and iteratively updates centroids until convergence.
- Calculates Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) to evaluate compactness.
- Visualizes clusters and centroids across all attribute pairs using scatter plots.

**Mini-programming project 6: Knapsack problem (Brute Force and Greedy)**

- Implements two approaches to the Knapsack problem: exhaustive brute-force search and a greedy density-based heuristic.
- Evaluates all feasible item combinations using binary masks to find the optimal solution.
- Compares results and execution time of both methods through a terminal interface.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone or Download this repository.
2. Open in Your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse) or build from the command line using Maven.
3. Run any of the tasks:
- Main Class: org.ml.Main (or another entry point, depending on your structure).
- The console prompts will guide you to choose a classifier, input vectors, etc.
4. Plotting:
- Some tasks use ASCII plots for quick visualization.
- Boundary points can also be exported to CSV and viewed in Excel, Python (matplotlib), or another plotting tool.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
- Java 17+ (tested with Java 17, should work with newer versions)
- Maven (for dependency management and building)
- No external libraries for core tasks (except optional libraries for advanced plotting)
